### Mini-hackathon on LLMs and GenAI APIs 2024
#### Organized by LauzHack

#### Developed by
- **Mekhron Bobokhonov**
- **Daniil Karzanov**
- **Jakhongir Saydaliev**

### Motivation
---
**Hands-on Practice with Coding Problems:** Technical mock interviews often involve live coding exercises, similar to what you might encounter in a real interview. This practice can help you think more clearly under pressure and refine your coding skills. 

**Feedback on Technical Skills:** You receive direct feedback on your problem-solving and coding techniques, which is crucial for identifying areas that need improvement before facing a real technical interview.

**Familiarization with Algorithmic Thinking: Regular practice with algorithm and data structure questions during mock interviews helps develop the algorithmic thinking required in many technical interviews.

Improves Code Explanation Skills: In addition to writing code, you often need to explain your approach and decision-making process during technical interviews. Mock interviews help you practice articulating your thought process clearly and concisely.

We begin our technical interview with a standard introduction and then the mock assistant gives first problem to the candidate.

We support two type of inputs: speech and text.

The interviewer will then present the problem and its requirements. 

The interviewer first asks for our approach to solve the problem before asking for the code implementation.

Based on the response, the interviewer will either confirm the solution or provide hints and, allowing the candidate to further elaborate on their answer.

If the answer is true then the interviewer asks for the code implementation.


The interviewer will then present the problem and its requirements. 

If the given approach is correct, then the interviewer ask for the code implementation and assess it.


After submitting their code, candidates receive quick feedback on and move on the next question if the solution is correct.


If the solution is wrong, it gives hints to work on the solution, and ask to repeat.

At the end of the interview, candidates receive feedback on their performance and suggestions for areas of improvement.
